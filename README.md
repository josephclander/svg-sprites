# Treehouse SVG Project

In this project, you'll use SVGs to spruce up and add a bit of character to a website. You’ll be given a website mockup, some basic HTML and CSS, and matching SVG files. You'll need to use the SVG files provided to match the mockup as closely as possible.

## Instructions

1. Background
   - In styles.css, use the background.svg file to create a tiled background on the body of the site, as shown on the mockup.
2. Menu
   - Create a navigation menu to match the mockups using the supplied SVGs.
   - When a user hovers over a nav menu item, use CSS to change the color of both the text AND the inline SVG.
3. Logo
   - Insert the SVG logo image (logo.svg) to match the mockup using the inline SVG method.
   - Ensure the logo SVG is the styled to the same size as the mockup example (140px x 120px).
   - At a page width of less than 425 pixels, remove the text from the logo and add an H1 tag that contains the logo text.
   - Be sure to use only min-width media queries.
4. Dog Images
   - Use the corgi.svg to create a <symbol> element for corgis in the the index.html file.
   - Use the <use> element to recreate four copies of the corgi svg in the layout of index.html matching the mockup.
   - Use the ‘currentColor’ CSS value to make the body of each corgi unique, matching the mockup.
